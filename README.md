What is an HTTP Server?

An **HTTP server** is a **program** that waits for messages (called **requests**) from clients usually web browsers, and responds by sending back **web content**, such as HTML pages, images, or data.

It's a **core building** block of the **web**: every time you open a website, you're interacting with an HTTP server behind the scenes.
